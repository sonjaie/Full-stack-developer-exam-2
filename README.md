# SpaceX

This React application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have installed Yarn and Node.js version 18. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

Install the dependencies with Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the Application

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
yarn start
```

View your application at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building for Production

Build the application for production to the `build` folder:

```bash
yarn build
```

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Serving the Application

After building the app, you can serve it with a static server:

```bash
yarn global add serve
serve -s build
```

The last command will serve your static site on the port 5000. Your app is now ready to be deployed!

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
